## About The Project
This is an implementation of a clustering algorithm based on symmetric non-negative matrix factorization.
It also includes code to compare its silhouette score aginst the KMeans algorithm (first K vectors are chosen as centroids deterministically) score.

This was a school project, so it is very rudimentary

## Preperations

### Prerequisites

* It is assumed you have Python and a C compiler already set up on your machine.

* NumPy and Pandas

* scikit-learn

* make (for makefile)


### Installation
In order to run this project you will need to compile it on your machine.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/OzCabiri/SymNMF_v1.git
   ```
2. Build symnmf executable
   ```sh
   make -f ./Makefile
   ```
3. Build the extension
   ```sh
   python setup.py build_ext --inplace
   ```

## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

### Using the Python interface:
The Python interface recieves 3 arguemtns: _k_, _goal_ and an _input file_.
* _k_ is the number of clusters
* _goal_ determines the function to produce
* _input file_ is a .txt file in a CSV format representing vectors

Ensure that _k_ is less than the number of vectors in your input file and that the vectors in _input file_ are of the same dimension.<br/>
_goal_ can be one of the following:
* _sym_: Prints the vectors' similarity matrix
* _ddg_: Prints the vectors' diagonal degree matrix
* _norm_: Prints the vectors' normalized similarity matrix
* _symnmf_: Derives a clustering solution and prints a matrix that can be viewd as an association matrix

Examples:
```sh
python symnmf.py 5 sym tests/input_1.txt
```
```sh
python symnmf.py 7 symnmf tests/input_3.txt
```
### Using the C interface:
The C interface recieves 2 arguemtns: _goal_ and an _input file_.
* _goal_ determines the function to produce
* _input file_ is a .txt file in a CSV format representing vectors

Ensure that _k_ is less than the number of vectors in your input file and that the vectors in _input file_ are of the same dimension.<br/>
_goal_ can be one of the following:
* _sym_: Prints the vectors' similarity matrix
* _ddg_: Prints the vectors' diagonal degree matrix
* _norm_: Prints the vectors' normalized similarity matrix

Examples:
```sh
./symnmf ddg tests/input_1.txt
```
```sh
./symnmf norm tests/input_2.txt
```

### Comparing silhouette scores of SymNMF and KMeans
The comparison is done with python and recieves 2 arguemtns: _k_ and an _input file_.
* _k_ is the number of clusters
* _input file_ is a .txt file in a CSV format representing vectors

Ensure that _k_ is less than the number of vectors in your input file and that the vectors in _input file_ are of the same dimension.<br/>

Example:
```sh
python analysis.py 5 tests/input_1.txt
```
